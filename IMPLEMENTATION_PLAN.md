# WHOOP Reverse Engineering Implementation Plan

This document outlines the roadmap for future development of the combined whoomp project, integrating features from both jogolden/whoomp and bWanShiTong/reverse-engineering-whoop repositories.

## Short-term Goals

### 1. Code Integration (Next 2 Weeks)

- [ ] Complete integration of tools from bWanShiTong repo
  - [x] Add extract-logs.sh script
  - [x] Add parse_pcap.py script
  - [x] Add misc.py utility functions
  - [x] Add DECODING documentation
  - [ ] Set up record-app for Android packet capture

- [ ] Enhance existing codebase
  - [ ] Refactor packet handling code to use improved CRC calculations
  - [ ] Implement additional command structure from bWanShiTong findings
  - [ ] Update UI to support new features

### 2. Data Analysis Improvements (Next Month)

- [ ] Enhance Heart Rate Data Processing
  - [ ] Improve anomaly detection and interpolation in historical records
  - [ ] Add more robust error handling for incomplete data
  - [ ] Implement more sophisticated heart rate data visualization

- [ ] Enhance HRV Analysis
  - [ ] Implement time-domain HRV metrics (RMSSD, SDNN, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement frequency-domain HRV metrics (LF, HF, LF/HF ratio)
  - [ ] Create visualization tools for HRV analysis
  - [ ] Generate WHOOP-like recovery scores

## Medium-term Goals (1-3 Months)

### 1. Additional Sensor Data

## Community Building

- [ ] Create documentation for onboarding new contributors
- [ ] Set up a communication channel for contributors
- [ ] Establish regular progress updates
- [ ] Create a roadmap for feature requests
- [ ] Develop a testing and validation process

## Ethical Considerations

This project is intended for research and educational purposes only. Contributors should:

- Respect WHOOP's intellectual property
- Focus on interoperability rather than circumvention
- Prioritize user privacy and data security
- Be transparent about limitations and accuracy
- Not interfere with WHOOP's business model or services

The goal is to create an open platform for research and personal data analysis while respecting the original device's design and purpose.
